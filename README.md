# istio-bug-report-analyzer-mcp

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that analyzes `istioctl bug-report` archives, identifies common problems, and suggests remediation steps.

## Features

- **Collect** bug reports by running `istioctl bug-report` against a target cluster
- **Load** existing `.tar.gz` archives or pre-extracted directories
- **Analyze** using built-in diagnostic templates for known issues
- **Query** specific sections of the archive (proxy configs, logs, istiod debug endpoints)
- **Generate** structured assessment documents with findings and remediation steps

## Installation

One command installs the MCP server, registers it with Claude Code, and adds the `/istio-report-assessment` skill:

```bash
npx istio-bug-report-analyzer-mcp@latest setup
```

Then restart Claude Code. You're ready to go.

## Updating

The MCP server automatically uses the latest version from npm each time Claude Code starts — no action needed for server updates.

To update the `/istio-report-assessment` skill (which lives locally on your machine), re-run setup:

```bash
npx istio-bug-report-analyzer-mcp@latest setup
```

Then restart Claude Code to pick up the new skill.
